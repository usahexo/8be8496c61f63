“We are excited to partner with the Bucks and NBA TV to bring this historic game to our fans,” said Danny Ainge, Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Celtics. “The Turning Stone Casino is a world-class facility and we know that our fans in New York and throughout the northeast will enjoy this unique opportunity to see the Celtics and Bucks face off live.”

The casino has hosted several high-profile events over the years, including concerts by Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, and Bon Jovi, as well as poker tournaments featuring some of the world’s top players. The basketball game will mark its first foray into sports.

“Basketball is one of the fastest-growing sports in North America and we are thrilled to partner with the Bucks and NBA TV to bring this historic preseason game to Turning Stone Resort Casino,” said Ray Halbritter, CEO of [https://www.oneidanation.com/Oneida- Nation -Enterprises/Oneida-Nation-Enterprises-.htm Oneida Nation Enterprises], which operates the casino. “Our resort offers top-notch amenities and a unique gaming experience and we look forward to welcoming basketball fans from all over North America to watch this exciting matchup between two of the NBA’s best teams.”

#  Bucks Will Play First Game at Off-Site Venue in Club's History

The Milwaukee Bucks will play their first game at an off-site venue in the team's history on Wednesday night as they take on the Chicago Bulls at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena.

Milwaukee is coming off a 107-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday, while Chicago dropped its most recent game to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 129-112. The Bucks have won five of their last six games while the Bulls have lost four of their last six.

"It's going to be great," Giannis Antetokounmpo said of playing at UWM Panther Arena. "I know a lot of people from Milwaukee are going to come and watch us play."

Tickets for Wednesday night's game went on sale to the general public on Monday morning and were sold out within minutes. The Bucks are expecting a record crowd for the game.

The Bucks are 1-4 all-time in games played at off-site venues, with their only victory coming against the Utah Jazz on Dec. 9, 1978, at then-Marquette University Arena. Milwaukee has played 31 regular season games at home over the last two seasons and has averaged 17,805 fans per game.

#  Bucks to Face Hawks in Upstate New York

The Milwaukee Bucks will travel to face the Atlanta Hawks in upstate New York on Wednesday night.

Both teams are coming off of losses on Monday night. The Bucks fell to the Boston Celtics 114-107, while the Hawks lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers 127-110.

Atlanta has had the upper hand in this matchup lately, winning the last seven meetings between the two teams. This time around, Milwaukee will look to take advantage of playing at home in Madison Square Garden and end the Hawks’ winning streak.

In order to do so, they will need to get hot from behind the three-point line. They shot only 35 percent from deep against Boston and need to be closer to 40 percent if they want to beat Atlanta. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe both shot below 30 percent from three against the Celtics and will need to improve their shooting for Wednesday night’s game.

 Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee in scoring with 33 points against Boston and also grabbed 14 rebounds. He will need another big game if the Bucks want to win on Wednesday night.
