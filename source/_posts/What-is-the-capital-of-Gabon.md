#  What is the capital of Gabon?

The capital of Gabon is Libreville.

#  What is the currency of Gabon?

The currency of Gabon is the Central African Franc (XAF).

#  What is the population of Gabon?

The population of Gabon is around 1.7 million, making it the 44th most populous country in the world. The majority of the population (around 85%) is concentrated in the coastal region, with a density that varies from just 2 people per square kilometer in the forested eastern province to over 670 people per square kilometer in the province of Libreville, the country’s largest city.

Gabon’s population has grown rapidly over the past few decades: it was just over half a million in 1975 and 1.1 million in 1995. This growth is largely due to high fertility rates – Gabon has one of the highest birth rates in the world – and to migration from rural to urban areas. Life expectancy at birth is around 60 years, and there are around 95 boys for every 100 girls.

# Ethnic groups in Gabon

The majority of Gabon’s population belong to two ethnic groups: the Fang (around 40% of the population) and the Bantu (around 30%). The Fang are mainly concentrated in the north and east of the country, while the Bantu are mainly found in the south-west. Other ethnic groups make up around 5% of the population each, and include the Nzebi, Tchikaya, Baka Pygmy, Obamba, and Bedzan. French is spoken by almost all Gabonese people, although there are also a number of indigenous languages such as Fang (the official language), Myene, Bapounou/Ewondo, Bandjabi, Sango, and Komo.

#  What is the official language of Gabon?

Gabon's official language is French. This may come as a surprise to some, as Gabon is located in Africa and French is not typically associated with the African continent. However, it makes sense when you consider that Gabon was formerly a French colony.

Gabon became an independent country in 1960, and while the official language has remained French, there has been an effort over the years to promote other languages spoken in Gabon as well. These include Fang, Bantu, and Portuguese.

Nevertheless, the majority of Gabonese citizens speak French as their first language. In fact, according to the 2016 census, approximately 80% of the population speaks French fluently. This makes Gabon one of the most francophone countries in Africa.

# What are some key expressions in Gabonese French?

If you're travelling to Gabon or planning to study the language, it's important to learn some key expressions in Gabonese French. Here are a few to get you started:

Bonjour (Hello)
Je m'appelle… (My name is…)
Comment allez-vous? (How are you?)
Pardon? (Pardon me?)
Où est la toilette? (Where is the toilet?)

#  What is the GDP of Gabon?

The GDP of Gabon is $36.3 billion as of 2019. This makes Gabon the 139th largest economy in the world. The GDP per capita is $10,900, making Gabon a middle-income country.

Gabon's economy is dominated by oil and gas production. These resources account for over 90% of exports and more than 70% of government revenue. As a result, the country has seen rapid economic growth in recent years. However, this growth has not been evenly spread across all segments of the population. The majority of Gabonese live in poverty, while a small elite enjoys the benefits of the oil wealth.

The Gabonese government has made efforts to diversify the economy in recent years, with limited success. The country hopes to develop tourism, agriculture, and forestry sectors to reduce its dependence on oil and gas exports. However, these sectors remain underdeveloped and have not yet contributed significantly to GDP.

Overall, Gabon's economy is relatively stable but faces several challenges moving forward. The country must find ways to diversify its economy and increase growth rates for all segments of the population in order to improve living standards.
