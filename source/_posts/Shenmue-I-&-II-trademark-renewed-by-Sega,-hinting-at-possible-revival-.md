#  Shenmue I & II trademark renewed by Sega, hinting at possible revival 

On July 3, 2018, Sega trademarked Shenmue I and II, renewing hope among fans of the beloved Dreamcast classics that the company may be planning a revival.

The trademarks were filed in Europe and Japan, and while no official confirmation has been given by Sega as to what the filings mean, it's hard not to speculate that they could be gearing up for a new release of the two games.

Shenmue I & II were first released in 1999 and 2000 respectively on the Dreamcast console. They told the story of Ryo Hazuki as he set out to avenge his father's death and uncover the secrets behind the mysterious Shenmue.

The games were highly acclaimed for their cinematic cutscenes, sandbox gameplay, and voice acting, all of which helped set them apart from other video games at the time. A sequel, Shenmue II, was released in 2001.

Following the release of Shenmue II however, development on further sequels was halted when creator Yu Suzuki left Sega. This left the series unfinished with many plot threads unresolved.

Since then there have been several attempts by fans to revive the series through crowdfunding campaigns, but none have been successful.

If Sega does announce a revival of Shenmue I & II, it will be their first new release in the series since 2001.

#  What can you do with gambling tokens in Shenmue? 

The world of Shenmue is filled with all sorts of goodies for the player to find and collect. Among these items are gambling tokens, which can be used at various gaming establishments in the game. So what can you do with gambling tokens in Shenmue?

The most straightforward use for gambling tokens is, of course, to gamble with them. They can be used at the casino in Wan Chai or at the slot machines in Dobuita. Gambling with tokens can be a fun way to pass the time, and it’s also a good way to make some extra money.

Tokens can also be traded in for prizes at certain stores. For example, the Token Exchange shop in Dobuita will trade a certain number of tokens for various items, including health drinks and capsules. This can be a great way to get some extra items without having to spend any money.

Finally, tokens can also be used as currency outside of gambling and prize exchanges. For example, many of the merchants in Dobuita will accept tokens as payment for goods and services. This can come in handy if you need to buy something but don’t have any yen on hand.

So those are some of the things that you can do with gambling tokens in Shenmue. Gambling is always a fun diversion, and being able to trade tokens for prizes or goods is a bonus. So next time you’re playing Shenmue, make sure to keep an eye out for those pesky little tokens!

#  Shenmue III still in development, Yu Suzuki teases new features 

A month ago, development on Shenmue III officially entered full production.

Since then, Yu Suzuki has teased a few new features for the game. 
On Twitter, he posted an image of what appears to be a detective case book, with the text "Ready for some sleuthing?"

In a subsequent tweet, he showed a screenshot of Ryo Hazuki talking on the phone in his in-game bedroom. The text accompanying the picture reads "Somebody's been kidnapped!"

While neither of these snippets provide any concrete information about the game itself, they do hint at some of the new content and mechanics that Suzuki and his team are working on. 

 Fans of the series have long been waiting for Shenmue III to finally be released, and it's exciting to see that development is progressing smoothly. Here's hoping that Suzuki can give us some more hints about the game in the near future!

#  How to get gambling tokens in Shenmue II 

Shenmue II is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega for the Dreamcast in 2001. The game is a sequel to Shenmue, with a larger open world and longer storyline.

The story of Shenmue II centers on Ryo Hazuki's journey to China in search of his father, Kenji Hazuki. Along the way, he makes new friends and allies, while also coming into conflict with formidable enemies.

One of the ways that players can get extra gambling tokens in Shenmue II is by winning them at the docks casino in Wan Chai. There are three different games that can be played at the docks casino: blackjack, poker, and slots.

In blackjack, players can bet between 1 and 10 tokens on each hand. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beating the dealer's hand in the process. In poker, players can bet between 1 and 25 tokens on each hand. The goal is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards on the table. In slots, players can bet between 1 and 5 tokens on each spin. There are three paylines in play on the slot machine, and players can win up to 500 tokens for landing three matching symbols on any of the paylines. 

Players can also find gambling tokens scattered throughout the game world. There are 100 tokens hidden in each district of Hong Kong, for a total of 1000 tokens available in the game. Finding all of the tokens is not required for completion, but it does provide an extra challenge for those who want to collect them all.

#  What are Gambling Tokens in Shenmue and what can you do with them?

Gambling Tokens in Shenmue were a way to gamble with your friends and enemies to get rewards. You could also use them as currency at some stores in the game.

In order to gamble, you needed at least two Gambling Tokens. Then, you would need to find someone willing to gamble with you. The game would randomly choose either player to start the gamble. If the player lost, they would then give the other player one of their Gambling Tokens. If the player won, they would take one of the opponent’s Gambling Tokens.

There were three different types of gambling games that could be played: Black Jack, Poker and Roulette.
