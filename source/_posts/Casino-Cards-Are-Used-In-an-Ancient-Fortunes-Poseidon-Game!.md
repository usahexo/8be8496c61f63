#  Used casino cards given new life in ancient fortunes game

An interesting new game is spreading throughout the country and even to parts of the world. The game is called ancient fortunes. It is played with a deck of custom casino cards, each of which has a different value. The number on the card corresponds to the amount of money that is won or lost.

Some people might be skeptical about using old casino cards in a new game, but this innovative idea is actually giving new life to the cards. They were originally destined for the trash bin, but now they are being used to make money. In fact, some people have even managed to win quite a bit of money playing ancient fortunes.

The game can be played with any number of people, but it is best when there are at least four players. One player is designated as the banker, and the others take turns being players. The banker deals out all of the cards face down, and then sets one card aside face up. This card is called the ante.

Each player then looks at their cards and decides how many they want to bet. The minimum bet is two cards, and the maximum bet is five cards. After everyone has placed their bets, the player who has the highest value card showing on their hand starts the action by flipping over their first card. If this card matches the ante, then they must either fold or put in another two cards (this would bring them up to four). If their card does not match the ante, then they can either put in another two cards or end their turn.

The next player flips over their first card and so on until all of the cards have been turned over. If at any time a player has five matching numbers (or four matching numbers and an ace), they automatically win and are dealt another hand by the banker. The rest of the players continue playing until there is only one left, who loses whatever they have left in their hand
