#  At Le Rupeyron, discover the unique Bugatti roulette game in Seychelles!

When in Seychelles, do as the locals do and visit the casino at Le Rupeyron. Try your luck at the Bugatti roulette game – a uniquely Seychellois experience not to be missed!

The Bugatti roulette game is inspired by the famous car manufacturer and gets its name from the distinctive wheel design. The game is played on a traditional roulette table with a green cloth and red and black betting areas.

In addition to the standard betting options, players can also make two special bets on the Bugatti wheel. These are called ‘En plein’ and ‘Cheval’ and involve betting on a number or range of numbers that will be displayed on the wheel once it stops spinning.

If you’re feeling lucky, place your bet on the ‘En plein’ option and hope that your chosen number comes up. Alternatively, try your hand at ‘Cheval’ betting by selecting two neighbouring numbers on the wheel. This is a more risky option but could lead to bigger payouts if it comes in!
