#  Poker Tournament Winners to Play at Sun Bingo

The inaugural Sun Bingo Poker Tournament took place at The Grosvenor Casino, London on Saturday 14th of January. The £200 buy-in event featured a field of 95 players, each looking to take down the top prize of £5,000.

After around six hours of play, it was 36-year-old Iqbal “Iq” Hussain who emerged victorious, defeating Londoner Mihai “The Magician” Manole in the heads-up battle. Hussain, who lives in North London and works as a Management Consultant, collected £5,000 for his efforts, while Manole took home £2,500 for his second-place finish.

Hussain began the final table as one of the short stacks but found himself in a commanding position after eliminating two players in quick succession. First he sent Amir Pouria packing with A♥K♦ against Pouria’s J♦10♣ and then he beat Rajesh Sharma with K♥Q♥ against Sharma’s A♠9♣.

Manole then doubled up through Hussain when his K♠Q♦ flopped two pair against Hussain’s A♣4♦ but it wasn’t long before Hussain was back in control and he eventually dispatched Manole with Q♦J♥ against Manole’s J♣10♦ to win the tournament.
