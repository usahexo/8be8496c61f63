#  Nevada and Delaware join New Jersey in legalizing sports betting

The US Supreme Court has overturned a 1992 law that banned sports betting in every state except Nevada. The 6-3 decision paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. The case was brought by New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011.

New Jersey's case hinged on the argument that the federal law violated the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees states sovereignty. The Court agreed, ruling that the federal government cannot dictate how states regulate gambling within their borders.

The decision is a major victory for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has made legalization of sports betting a key part of his economic agenda. It's also a win for casino operators in Atlantic City, who have been struggling to compete with casinos in other states.

Nevada and Delaware are the first states to take advantage of the Court's ruling, with both states announcing plans to legalize sports betting within the next few weeks. Other states are likely to follow suit, as they see an opportunity to generate new revenue and create jobs.

Sports betting is a big business in the United States. Total bets placed on NFL games last year exceeded $100 billion, with over $4 billion wagered on Super Bowl 50 alone. With so much money at stake, legalized sports betting is sure to be a hot topic in state legislatures across the country.

#  Atlantic City casino offers sports betting on Schalke 04

On Thursday, the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City announced that it would begin taking sports bets on Schalke 04, a German Bundesliga soccer club.

The Borgata is the first casino in New Jersey to offer betting on Schalke 04 games. Bettors will be able to make wagers both online and in person at the casino.

John210, a user on the sports betting forum Sportsbook Review, said that he planned to take advantage of the new offering.

"I'm definitely going to put some action down on Schalke now that I can do so legally," John210 wrote. "I have no idea who is going to win their game tomorrow against Bayer Leverkusen, but I'm interested in seeing how the line moves."

Schalke 04 is one of 18 teams in the Bundesliga, Germany's top professional soccer league. The club has won seven German championships and four German cups.

#  Schalke 04 Fans Can Bet On Matches In Nevada

A recent ruling in the state of Nevada now allows fans of Schalke 04 to place bets on the outcomes of their club's matches. This is a landmark decision, as no other team in the Bundesliga has previously been allowed to have their matches wagered on.

Nevada Gaming Control Board chairman A.G. Burnett said that the organization is looking to expand its sports betting offerings, and that Schalke 04 was a natural choice for inclusion. "The Bundesliga is one of the most popular leagues in the world, and Schalke 04 is one of its most popular clubs," Burnett said in a statement. "We are excited to offer this new form of entertainment to our customers."

Schalke 04 officials have welcomed the news, with marketing director Alexander Jobst saying that it will give the club a chance "to raise our visibility in international markets." He added that he is confident that the move will be good for both Schalke 04 and Nevada gaming interests.

Fans of the club seem equally enthusiastic about the development, with many expressing hope that they will be able to make some money by betting on their favorite team. Some, however, are also concerned about potential match-fixing scandals, something that has long been a concern in soccer.

Burnett downplayed those concerns, saying that his agency has "a robust system in place to protect against match-fixing and other types of fraud." He added that the Nevada Gaming Control Board takes its responsibility to ensure a fair game seriously and will take whatever steps are necessary to protect players and fans alike.

#  Sports Betting Now Available For Schalke 04 Games In Delaware

Delaware sports fans now have the opportunity to place bets on Schalke 04 games, as the state's lottery commission announced a new partnership with Sportradar AG, a global leader in sports betting data and services, on Thursday.

"The Delaware Lottery is always looking for ways to improve the gaming experience for our players," said Lottery Director Vernon Kirk. "This partnership with Sportradar will allow us to offer our players the ability to bet on one of Europe's most popular soccer teams."

Under the terms of the agreement, Sportradar will provide real-time betting data for all Schalke 04 contests played in Germany's Bundesliga and Europe's UEFA Champions League. In addition, Sportradar will host a Schalke 04 information page on its online betting portal, offering fans the latest news, team history, and odds for upcoming matches.

The agreement marks the latest expansion of Sportradar's U.S. operations, which already includes partnerships with more than 20 state lotteries and major sports leagues including the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.

"We're excited to be working with the Delaware Lottery Commission to bring Schalke 04 betting action to U.S. fans," said Andreas Kötter, Sportradar's Executive Vice President of Global Gaming Operations. "Bundesliga soccer is extremely popular across North America and we expect that this partnership will generate significant interest from Delaware sports fans."

Fans can place bets on Schalke 04 games at any of Delaware's three casinos or via self-service betting terminals at local gas stations. For more information or to place a wager online, visit www.delawarelottery.com/schalke04betting

#  Schalke 04 Brings Gambling Revenue To New Jersey

The Schalke 04 soccer club, in partnership with casino gaming company Golden Nugget Atlantic City, has announced the launch of a new online sports betting venture in New Jersey. The move comes as the state looks to increase its gambling revenue and Schalke looks to tap into the growing U.S. market for soccer.

The Schalke 04 online sports betting venture is available through Golden Nugget’s website and offers odds on all major international soccer matches. In addition to betting on the games, users can also access Schalke-related content, including news, player profiles, and club history.

“We are excited to partner with Golden Nugget Atlantic City to launch our new online sports betting venture in New Jersey,” said Alexander Jobst, chief marketing officer at Schalke 04. “This represents an important step in our ongoing efforts to expand our global reach and connect with fans around the world.”

Schalke is one of Germany’s most popular soccer clubs, with more than 290,000 members. The team has won seven Bundesliga championships and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League twice in recent years.

Gambling is a key part of the global soccer market, with billions of dollars wagered on games each year. In the U.S., where sports betting is currently illegal in most states, that figure is estimated to be over $100 billion annually. However, that is expected to change in the coming years as more states legalize gambling (including New Jersey).

Golden Nugget Atlantic City is one of the largest casino operators in Atlantic City and currently offers online sports betting services throughout New Jersey. The company was recently acquired by Landry’s Inc., a leading hospitality company with more than 500 properties worldwide.
