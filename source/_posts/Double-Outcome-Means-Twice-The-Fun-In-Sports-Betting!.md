#  Double Outcome Means Twice The Fun In Sports Betting!

As an avid sports fan, nothing gets my blood boiling quite like a close and frenzied game. But as someone who loves to make a wager or two on the games, nothing is more exhilarating than when that tight matchup delivers a double outcome!

That's right, a double outcome means that both teams covered the point spread and the over/under was hit as well. For example, if the Cowboys were playing the Redskins and the spread was Dallas -3 and the over/under was set at 43, then if Dallas won by exactly four points (covering the spread) and the game ended with 44 total points scored (hitting the over/under), then that would constitute a double outcome.

Now some casual bettors might bemoan a game that delivers a double outcome, thinking it means they didn't win their bet outright. But for those of us who love to risk a little bit in order to potentially win big, there is no thrill quite like watching two teams battle it out and both cover the number. In fact, when I have several bets riding on different outcomes in one game, I consider it almost like hitting a trifecta in horse racing!

Granted, not every game will produce a double outcome. In fact, they are relatively rare. But when they do happen, it's like getting free money on top of your original wager. So next time you find yourself glued to a nail-biter of a game, keep your eyes peeled for that potential double outcome!

# 3. Double Your Fun With 1xBet's Double Outcome Betting Option!

Most online betting sites and sportsbooks offer their customers the chance to bet on the outcome of a game or match. This is usually a straight up bet on who will win, with the odds being offered by the betting site. However, 1xBet offers an additional option for those looking to add a little extra excitement to their betting - double outcome betting!

With this type of wager, you are not just betting on who will win, but also on how many goals will be scored. So, in addition to correctly predicting the winning team, you must also correctly guess how many goals they will score. This can add an extra layer of excitement to your bets, as well as potentially increase your profits if you get it right!

For example, let's say you think Manchester United will beat Chelsea 3-1. To place a double outcome bet on this game, you would need to select both Manchester United and Over 2.5 goals as your selections. If Manchester United wins 3-1, as you predicted, then you would win both your bets! If they only won 2-1 however, you would only win one of your bets (the one for Manchester United).

It's important to note that there is usually a lower payout for double outcome bets than for regular straight up bets - this is because there is more chance for things to go wrong. However, if you are confident in your predictions and want an added level of excitement when betting on games, then double outcome betting is definitely for you!
