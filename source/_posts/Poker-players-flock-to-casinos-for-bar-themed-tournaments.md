#  Poker players flock to casinos for bar-themed tournaments

Casino staff were busy getting the bar ready for the tournament. Poker players from all around the state had converged on the casino for the chance to win a share of the $2,500 prize pool. The tournament was a new concept for the casino, and they were hoping it would be a success.

The bar-themed tournament was the brainchild of casino marketing director Matt Hanlon. "I was watching a poker tournament on TV and I thought it would be fun to have one in our casino," said Hanlon. "I pitched the idea to our casino management and they liked it."

Hanlon worked with the casino's event coordinator to put together a tournament that would appeal to poker players. "We decided to make it a bar-themed tournament because that's where most of our poker players hang out," said Hanlon. "It's also a great way to promote our new bar."

The tournament started at 7 pm and by 7:15 pm there was a line of players waiting to register. "I've never seen anything like this before," said casino security guard Jerry Parker. "It's usually pretty quiet in here on Thursday nights."

The tournament got underway and soon there was a crowd of spectators watching the action at the bar. Players were eliminated one by one and soon there was only one player left standing. That player was Tony Campana, who took home first prize of $1,000.

"I'm really happy that I won," said Campana. "This is my first time playing in a bar-themed poker tournament and I'll definitely do it again."

#  Bar slot machine proving popular with poker tournament players

When the World Series of Poker kicked off last month at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, one of the new attractions on the casino floor was a bar slot machine. The machine, which is operated by Belgian company Interblock, is proving popular with poker tournament players.

“The bar slot machine has been a big hit with our poker players,” said Randy Blum, vice-president of marketing at the Rio.“In fact, we’ve had to move it to a more prominent location on the casino floor because so many people are playing it.”

The machine, which features a built-in touch screen display, allows players to place bets on blackjack, roulette and craps games as well as slots. It also offers live video streaming of gaming action from around the world.

According to Blum, most of the players who have tried the bar slot machine are unfamiliar with it. “But that’s part of its appeal – it’s a new experience for them. And they’re really enjoying it.”

#  Bar slots becoming hot new attraction for poker tourneys

With the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in full swing, it's no secret that some of the top poker players in the world are vying for their chance at a coveted gold bracelet. However, what may come as a surprise to some is the growing interest in bar slots – or "side games" – as a new and exciting attraction for poker tourneys.

In particular, bar slots offer players an opportunity to win big payouts without risking as much as they would in a traditional poker game. In many ways, this makes them especially appealing to amateur players who are looking to make a name for themselves without having to risk too much money.

Not surprisingly, then, bar slots are becoming increasingly popular among poker tourneys. In fact, Justin Bonomo – one of the world's top poker players – has recently said that he prefers playing bar slots over traditional poker games. According to Bonomo, bar slots offer a more exciting and dynamic experience that's conducive to bigger payouts.

So if you're looking for an exciting and lucrative alternative to traditional poker games, be sure to check out bar slots!
