#  Rhode Island Legalizes Sports Betting, Includes Hawaii!

Betting on sports is now considered legal in Rhode Island following the state legislature’s approval of a bill legalizing the activity. This development could pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting as well, including Hawaii where the activity is currently considered illegal.

The Rhode Island legislation, which was passed on Thursday, allows for both land-based and online sports betting. The latter option is significant as it could allow bettors to place their bets through their smartphones or computers. The state has already begun preparations for its launch of sports betting, with regulators working on regulations that will govern how the industry will function.

Officials estimate that legalized sports betting will generate $23 million in revenue for the state each year. That number could grow if other states follow Rhode Island’s lead and legalize the activity. In addition to the potential financial benefits, supporters of legalizing sports betting argue that it can help to prevent illegal gambling and can be used to fund programs for problem gamblers.

Hawaii is one of only a handful of states in the US that does not currently allow some form of legalized sports betting. That could soon change, however, as lawmakers there are currently studying the possibility of legalizing the activity. There is some opposition to legalization in Hawaii, with some arguing that it could lead to increased crime and addictive behavior. However, there is growing support for legalization as well and it is expected that lawmakers will consider a proposal sometime this year.

#  Rhode Island Residents Can Now Bet On Hawaii Sports Games 

The legalization of sports betting in Rhode Island brings a new opportunity for residents to place bets on Hawaii sports games. Bets can now be placed at the Ocean State’s two racinos and online through the state’s lottery website.

This new development provides Hawaii fans living in Rhode Island with a chance to support their favorite teams, as well as make some money off of the games. The move could also have a positive impact on tourism for the state of Hawaii, as those visiting Rhode Island may take the opportunity to place bets on their favorite games while in town.

Hawaii lawmakers have long been in favor of legalizing sports betting, and with this recent development, it appears that momentum is continuing to build. In May, a bill seeking to legalize sports betting in Hawaii was introduced in the state legislature. The bill would allow betting on all professional and college sports, as well as electronic gaming devices at race tracks and casinos.

While it is still too early to tell how this latest development will play out, it is clear that there are plenty of potential benefits to legalizing sports betting in Rhode Island. Fans now have another way to support their favorite teams, while the state stands to gain from increased tourism and tax revenue. With momentum continuing to build, it is only a matter of time before sports betting is legalized in Hawaii.

#  RI Residents Can Now Place Bets On Out-Of-State Sporting Events 

Residents in Rhode Island can now place bets on sporting events taking place outside of the state. This change was made as part of a larger gambling expansion bill that was signed into law by Governor Gina Raimondo.

There are some restrictions on which events residents can bet on, and the bets must be placed through the state's lottery system. The new law also allows for online and mobile betting, something that is expected to generate additional revenue for the state.

Rhode Island is not the first state to allow out-of-state betting, but it is one of the most expansive in terms of what events are covered. Other states have mostly limited their offerings to professional sports, while Rhode Island includes college and amateur events as well.

Supporters of the new law say that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems. Only time will tell who is correct in this debate.

#  Rhode Islanders Will Be Able To Bet On Hawaii's Upcoming Sporting Events 

Rhode Islanders will now be able to place bets on Hawaii's upcoming sporting events, thanks to a new ruling from the Rhode Island Gaming Commission. This opens up a whole new market for Hawaii's sports teams, and could help to increase tourism for the state as well.

The decision was made in response to a request from the Twin River Casino in Lincoln, RI. The casino sought permission to offer bets on sporting events taking place in other states, and the commission granted that request. "We're very excited about it," said casino spokesman Dan Englander. "It's something our customers have been asking for."

Hawaii's major sports teams are likely to benefit from this new development. The University of Hawaii football team, for example, will now have a chance to attract more fans from Rhode Island. And the Hawaii State Department of Tourism is hopeful that the increased interest in Hawaii will lead to an increase in tourism dollars.

So far, it's unclear exactly which sporting events will be available for betting in Rhode Island. The commission has said that it will make a final decision on that soon. In the meantime, there is plenty of speculation about which games will be included. The most popular choices include the Super Bowl and March Madness brackets.

Regardless of which games are ultimately offered for betting, this move is sure to be welcomed by avid sports fans in Rhode Island. It provides them with another way to excitement during their favorite sporting events, while also giving them a chance to potentially win some money.

#  New Bill In Rhode Island Allows For Sports Gambling, Including Bets On Hawaii Teams

Rhode Island is the latest state to legalize sports gambling, following the lead of a number of other states in the past year. The new law allows for bets on teams from any state, including Hawaii, as well as any other professional or collegiate sport.

The law went into effect on January 1st, and casinos and other gambling establishments are already gearing up to offer sports betting to their customers. In addition to betting on individual games, bettors will also be able to wager on futures contracts, predicting which team will win a given championship.

Casinos are expecting a large influx of business as a result of the new law, and many are making preparations to increase the number of gambling machines and other amenities available to their customers.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased addiction and gambling-related problems, but supporters say that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state.
